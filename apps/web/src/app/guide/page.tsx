				<h3>Using Slots</h3>
				<p>
					Signup slots are how <PotluckQuest /> helps you plan meals. A slot
					represents a request for a specific type and number of itemâ€”e.g., main
					course, appetizers, drinks, or packages of paper plates.{" "}
					<OpenAiLogo /> can help you determine what you need to support the
					number of attendees you expect at your event.
				</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Creating Slots</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The <Link href="/plan">planning wizard</Link> of <PotluckQuest />{" "}
							is where you create and customize signup slots. <OpenAiLogo /> can
							suggest dish types and quantities based on your event details and
							the number of attendees.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use of <OpenAiLogo /> suggestions is completely optional. The only
							information shared is the number of attendees and the details of
							the event you're planning.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>Signing Up for Slots</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Use <code>/slots</code> in your <DiscordLogo /> server to view
							available slots and sign up.
