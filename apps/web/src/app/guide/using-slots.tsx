			Signup slots are how <PotluckQuest /> helps you plan meals. A slot
			represents a request for a specific type and number of itemâ€”e.g., main
			course, appetizers, drinks, or packages of paper plates. <OpenAiLogo />{" "}
			can help you determine what you need to support the number of attendees
			you expect at your event.

					number of attendees.

				<li>
					Use of <OpenAiLogo /> suggestions is completely optional. The only
					information shared is the number of attendees and the details of the
					event you&apos;re planning.
